##Lab 0 - Setup

1. Install an IDE.  The lab instructions are written for Spring Tool Suite, but you can use regular Eclipse, IntelliJ, or another IDE if desired.
1. Download Files from https://github.com/kennyk65/Microservices-With-Spring-Student-Files (Use download ZIP, or Clone in Desktop, whichever you prefer)
1. Import all of the downloaded Maven projects into your IDE

Notice that:
- Not all subfolders within the student files contain Maven projects.
- Projects are grouped by lab #, each corresponding to a module in the course.
- Projects suffixed with “solution” are intended to illustrate the completed version of each lab.

- Create an account on GitHub.  This will be needed for Lab 3, config server.

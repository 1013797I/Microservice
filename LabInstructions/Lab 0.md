Lab 0 - Setup
- Install an IDE.  The lab instructions are written for Spring Tool Suite, but you can use regular Eclipse, IntelliJ, or another IDE if desired.
- Download Files from https://github.com/kennyk65/Microservices-With-Spring-Student-Files (Use download ZIP, or Clone in Desktop, whichever you prefer)
- Import all of the downloaded Maven projects into your IDE

Notice that:
Not all subfolders within the student files contain Maven projects.
Projects are grouped by lab #, each corresponding to a module in the course.
Projects suffixed with “solution” are intended to illustrate the completed version of each lab.

- Create an account on GitHub.  This will be needed for Lab 3, config server.

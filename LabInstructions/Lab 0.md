##Lab 0 - Setup

1. [Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and install the latest release of the Java JDK.  The lab instructions have been tested with Java 7 and 8, so if you already have one of these installed you should be fine.
2. [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and install Maven 2 or greater if you do not already have it.
3. Install an IDE.  The lab instructions are written for [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all), but you can use regular Eclipse, IntelliJ, or another IDE if desired.
4. Create a [Github](https://github.com) account, or be prepared to create a repository using another Git account that you already have access to.
5. Download Files from [https://github.com/kennyk65/Microservices-With-Spring-Student-Files](https://github.com/kennyk65/Microservices-With-Spring-Student-Files) (Use download ZIP, or Clone in Desktop, whichever you prefer)
6. Import all of the downloaded Maven projects into your IDE.
7. Optional - Find and install a REST plugin for the web browser that you would like to use for this course.  For example, I use "Simple REST Client" in Chrome.

Notice that:
- Not all subfolders within the student files contain Maven projects.
- Projects are grouped by lab #, each corresponding to a module in the course.
- Projects suffixed with “solution” are intended to illustrate the completed version of each lab.
